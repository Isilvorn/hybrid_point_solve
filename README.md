# Hybrid Point Solve
A PDE Solver originally implemented in Fortran for the Fun3D (Fully Unstructured 3D Grid) NASA fluid flow simulation ecosystem.  This version has been converted to C and the OpenMP and CUDA language extensions have been utilized to allow the solve routines to exploit parallelism on both the CPU and GPU simultaneously.
